## API

API(Application programming interface) is originally understood to be an application specific computing interface exposed by a particular software program or operation system to allow third parties to extend the functionality of that software application.

## ABI

ABI(Application binary interface) is an iterface between two binary program modules.

API guarantees compatibility at the source code level, ABI ensures compatibility of the binary.
