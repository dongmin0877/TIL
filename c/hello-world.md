# Hello World

```c
#include <stdio.h>

main()
{
  printf("hello, world\n");
}
```

On the UNIX system you must create the program as a ".c", such as "hello.c", then compile it with the command.

```shell
cc hello.c
```

Compiler makes an executable file called a.out. If you run a.out by typing the command. It will print
`"hello, world"`
