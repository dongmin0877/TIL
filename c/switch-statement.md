# Switch statement in C

`switch statement` supports multiple decision.

```c
switch (expression) {
    case const-expr: statements
    case const-expr: statements
    default: statements
}
```

case is labeled by const or expression. If a case matches the const or expression value, statements are executed. The case labeled `default` is executed if none of the other cases are matched.
